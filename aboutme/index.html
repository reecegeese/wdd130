    <h2>Reece Loveridge</h2>
    <p>My name is Reece Loveridge. This is my second semester here at BYUI. My current major is undecided 
        but I want to go into some form of computer codeing or computer science. My dream job is to go into
        video game design. My favorite part of BYUI is the gym, which I use frequently
    </p>
    <p>
        Some hobbies of mine include working out at the gym, watching TV shows with my roomates and playing games
    </p>
    <p>I am exited to take this class because it will broaden my horizons of the codeing world.
        I am also exited because in highschool web design was not my favorite and I stopped understanding what
        I was doing near the end of the class. I would like to improve my web design skills, even if I don't intend
        to make it my career

        I have been a memeber of the church my whole life. My favorite speaker is Dieter F. Uchtdorf because of his
        funny plane stories. On of my favorite quotes from conference was Uchtdorf telling a story about him
        and President Monson taking a plane ride together. Uchtdorf was sitting in the co-poilet's seet and was
        imagining taking a hand of the controls and flying the plane himself. Then before he even moved Monson
        yells from behind him "Dieter, don't even think about it." My favorite scripture story is the one of
        Jesus yelling at the merchants who are using the temple as just another building
